# gatling-demo
A project that keeps simple Gatling simulation samples

## Prerequisites
Installation prerequisites from the [official documentation](https://gatling.io/docs/current/installation)
* OpenJDK 8 or OpenJDK 11 with HotSpot
* Scala 2.12
* [Scala SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Setup.html)

## Note before running simulations
Configuration file **project.conf** contains a number of users, that could be injected during the simulation. 
As far as simulations affect existing third party services, that are open for testing, please, be kind and do not overload these services with more than 10 users per test.

## Simulations

The simplest successful simulation with successful checks is SuccessfulSimulation in *io.billie.simulations.simplest_samples package*. 
It could be run as:
```
sbt "gatling:testOnly io.billie.simulations.simplest_samples.SuccessfulSimulation"
```
---
The simplest successful simulation with failed checks is SuccessfulButWithFailedCheckSimulation in *io.billie.simulations.simplest_samples package*. 
It could be run as:
```
sbt "gatling:testOnly io.billie.simulations.simplest_samples.SuccessfulButWithFailedCheckSimulation"
```
---
The simplest failing simulation is FailedSimulation in *io.billie.simulations.simplest_samples package*. 
It could be run as:
```
sbt "gatling:testOnly io.billie.simulations.simplest_samples.FailedSimulation"
```
---
The package *io.billie.simulations.feeders_usage_samples* contains simulations, that represent samples of usage for popular feeders:
- CSV Feeder (CsvFeederSimulation)
- JSON Feeder (JsonFeederSimulation)
- Custom feeder, populated with random data generated by your utils or integrated libraries (CustomFeederSimulation)

The run is performed in the same way as runs above. Example:
```
sbt "gatling:testOnly io.billie.simulations.feeders_usage_samples.CsvFeederSimulation"
```
---
The package *io.billie.simulations.actions_usage_sample* contains ActionsSimulation simulation, that represents a way to make scenarios as simple actions, reusable for multiple cases in more complicated scenarios

## Reports
A [report](https://gatling.io/docs/current/general/reports) is stored in **gatling-demo/target/gatling/** directory after the end of simulation as an HTML file.
